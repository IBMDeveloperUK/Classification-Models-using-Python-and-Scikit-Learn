# Classification-Models-using-Python-and-Scikit-Learn

In this tutorial, we describe the basics of solving a classification-based machine learning problem, and do a comparative study of two popular algorithms.

## Getting Started with Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter notebooks are an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. 

In this workshop we will use IBM Watson Studio to run a notebook. For this you will need an IBM Cloud account. The following steps will show you how sign up and get started. When you have the notebook up and running we will go through the notebook. 

## IBM Cloud

- [Sign up](https://ibm.biz/BdfMGx) for an IBM Cloud account

- When you are signed up click `Create Resource` at the top of the Resources page. You can find the resources under the hamburger menu at the top left:

- Select the Lite plan and click `Create`.
- Go back to the Resources list and click on your Watson Studio service and then click `Get Started`.

## IBM Watson Studio

### 1. Create a new Project

- You should now be in Watson Studio.
- 
- Click on the Projects option to create a New project.

- click `Create`.  


## 4. Load and run a notebook

-  Add a new notebook. Click `Add to project` and choose `Notebook`:

- Choose new notebook `From URL`. Give your notebook a name and copy the URL `https://github.com/IBMDeveloperUK/Classification-Models-using-Python-and-Scikit-Learn/blob/main/Notebook/Classification_models.ipynb`
- Select the custom runtime enviroment that you created and click `Create Notebook`. 
-  The notebook will load. 
 
<b> You are now ready to follow along with the workshop in the notebook! </b>
